Component Structure Best Practices

Overview

A well-structured component architecture ensures maintainability, scalability, and reusability in frontend applications. This document outlines best practices for organizing components effectively.

🏗️ General Principles

1️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle SRP (same core concepts as ["SOLID" found on my  SOLID repo here.](https://github.com/thefutureseer/solid-clean-code-principles) )

Each component should have one specific purpose. If a component becomes too complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, reusable components.

2️⃣ Folder Structure for Scalability

A scalable frontend benefits from a well-organized directory structure:

- Modularity – Separating components by category improves maintainability.
- Reusability – The common/ folder ensures UI elements are easily reusable.
- Scalability – The pages/ folder helps keep page-specific logic separate.
- Separation of Concerns – hooks/, context/, and utils/ separate logic from UI.

1. Consider a features/ Folder
- For large applications, a feature-based structure can work better.
- This approach groups all related files inside specific domains (e.g., auth, dashboard).

```
2. Maybe Rename context/ to providers/. context/ is fine, but some prefer providers/ to clarify its purpose.
3. Should hooks/ Be Inside utils/?

- If hooks are shared across multiple components, consider putting them inside utils/.
Otherwise, keeping them separate in hooks/ is fine.

3️⃣ Use a Naming Convention

Use PascalCase for component files (Button.jsx, UserCard.tsx).

Use camelCase for hooks (useFetchData.js).

Keep filenames consistent with component names.

4️⃣ Separation of Concerns (SoC)
Keep UI logic (JSX/TSX) separate from business logic.
Avoid mixing state management inside presentational components.
A system should be divided into layers (controllers, services, repositories).
A frontend should have clearly defined UI components, state management, API calls, and utilities.

### 🚀 **Applying SoC in a Scalable Frontend App**
✔ **Component-Based Architecture** (UI in components, logic in hooks, data in state).  
✔ **Feature-Based Folder Structure** (e.g., `auth`, `dashboard`, `profile`).  
✔ **State Management Layer** (React Context, Redux, Zustand).  
✔ **API Services in Separate Modules** (`services/api.js`).  
✔ **CSS in Dedicated Files** (`styles/global.css`, CSS Modules, Tailwind).  

📦 Types of Components

1️⃣ Atomic Design (Optional but Recommended)

A structured way to break down UI components:

Atoms → Basic elements (buttons, input fields).

Molecules → Groups of atoms (e.g., form fields with labels).

Organisms → Complex UI sections (e.g., a navbar with multiple elements).

Templates → Page-level layout structures.

Pages → Actual screens for routes (HomePage.tsx).

2️⃣ Container vs. Presentational Components

Presentational Components: UI-focused, stateless (Button, Card).

Container Components: Handle state and data fetching (UserListContainer).

🏎️ Performance Considerations

1️⃣ Use React.memo for Optimization

2️⃣ Lazy Load Heavy Components

3️⃣ Minimize Re-Renders

Use useMemo for expensive computations.

Use useCallback to memoize functions.

Avoid unnecessary state changes.

✅ Best Practices Summary

✅ Keep components small and reusable.  
✅ Follow consistent naming conventions.  
✅ Use context, hooks, and state management wisely.  
✅ Optimize performance with memoization and lazy loading.  
✅ Ensure folder structure scales with the project.
