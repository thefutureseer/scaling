## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of best practices, patterns, and case studies for building scalable applications. It covers multiple aspects of application development, from the frontend to the backend, along with DevOps and infrastructure considerations.

## Frontend

The frontend section includes scalability considerations, best practices for component structure, state management, and performance optimization. It also highlights how to use frameworks like React and Next.js efficiently.

- **[Frontend Scalability](frontend/frontend_scalability.md)**
- **Component Structure**
- **State Management**
- **React Best Practices**

## Backend

In the backend section, we cover how to scale backend services, different architectural patterns like microservices vs. monolithic approaches, and strategies for working with databases.

- **Backend Scalability**
- **Microservices vs. Monolith**
- **Event Driven Architecture**
- **Sharding vs. Replication**
- **Caching Strategies**

## Infrastructure

A deep dive into infrastructure scaling, including cloud services, load balancing, and networking optimizations.

- **[Cloud Scalability](infrastructure/cloud_scalability.md)**
- **[Load Balancing](infrastructure/load_balancing.md)**
- **[Containerization](infrastructure/containerization.md)**
- **[Networking for Scalability](infrastructure/networking.md)**


## DevOps

The DevOps section includes strategies for scaling infrastructure and managing Kubernetes clusters for autoscaling.

- **Scaling Infrastructure**
- **Kubernetes Autoscaling**

## API Scalability

Covers API rate limiting, caching, and handling high-traffic endpoints efficiently.

## Security Considerations

Ensuring scalability while maintaining security through authentication, authorization, and DDoS protection.

## Monitoring & Observability

How to track and measure performance with logs, metrics, and tracing.


## Case Studies

We also have case studies of real-world applications and how they scale. Currently, we have:
